Welcome! 

In here I will present LilachShop. LilachShop is a software for managing a flower store. 

first, I will present the customer side, where the customer can login to his accout, make new orders, cancel his orders, send complaints to the store he bought the flowers from, and view the store's reply to his complaints. 

so this is the first screen the user see before login to his account:
![opening](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182020716-8cf6c186-c7ab-4338-9466-191f840a9b7b.jpg)

the user can press on different products from the list, and the pressed product will appear on the left side of the screen with additional information. 

![www_screencapture_com_2022-7-31_12_58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182021019-f13be648-9272-45a4-8ec8-bf30f975c280.gif)

if the user tries to add products to his cart, theres an error that indicates the user needs to login, so we go to the login screen:

![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182021184-441a4c50-408a-423a-89d8-f8328ddacb59.jpg)

if the user already have an account, he can login. if not, he can create a new account.
let's say we want to create a new account. this video showes all the stages needed to make a new account:
- choose user name and a password (the user name needs to be a name that is not already being used).
- insert information: first name, last name, phone number, address and email
- insert credit card information  
- choose account type: chain, annual or store account.

and now the user can login to his account:

![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182021797-4f386c93-e1d9-4e2e-b3c4-04525cc11f19.gif)

as seen in the giff, the user can choose the store he wants to purches items from (tel aviv, herzlya, haifa).

now the user can add items to his cart:

![order](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182021998-73d2e4de-d955-41d7-8c28-4262da991c1d.gif)

and when he's done he can make a new order, where he needs to add:
- greeting (can be empty)
- choose if order is made by delivery or self pickup
- credcard info - by default fills the user credit card information  

![make_order2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182022367-968277e3-bc0c-433a-953c-56437ef45d1f.gif)

the user can also look at his order history: 

![history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182023080-5e535a6b-360d-41e8-9e83-ec06e6d50a0a.jpg)

if the user is not pleased with his orders, he can send a complaint, or cancel the order (or both):

![complaints_cancel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182023822-134f7260-eec2-4178-95cf-d448714d6dcc.gif)

the user can also filter products by:
- price range
- item type
- dominant color

so this is pretty much it for what the customer can do using LilachShop.

now, I will present what lilach employees can do, using LilachShop software.

lilach chain has 5 types of employees:
- Chain manager
- Store manager
- Store employee
- Customer service employee
- System manager

so now, we will see what each employee can do, using LilachShop:

### Store Employee:

so at first, each employee has to login to his account: 

![employee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182024909-541b7248-dd6b-4646-ac24-8b5c4689f6f4.jpg)

we will login as a store employee, and this is the screen we see:

![welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182025009-d5efeb9d-d7c1-4b60-8f26-5b59bc92811c.jpg)

a store employee can edit the catalog of the store. 
![catalog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182028332-5f7b626c-2a06-4789-befb-cc6cc7fc3a58.jpg)

this means he can add or change information of existing items:

![ezgif com-gif-maker (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182028536-593b960d-801d-41e4-b1b5-aad3317caffd.gif)

or add new items:

![ezgif com-gif-maker (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182028717-e3365875-3f7a-4c84-abad-fe3b6b198987.gif)

a store employee can also look at all of the orders that has been made at the store he works on:

![orders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182028992-fde16db5-7140-416b-8aa1-2aa27fb0e492.jpg)

and change the status of an existing order:

![status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182029036-cf324c7e-ae5c-462f-ab49-144a4889b9d1.jpg)

### Store Manager:

a manager of a store can do everything a store employee can do. 

but a store manager can also view reports regarding number of orders, complaints and income to a period of time that he chooses. 

this video showes an example:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182029689-974795e5-a495-44e3-b447-118e0d85a282.mp4

### Chain manager

A chain manager can do everything a store manager can do. the chain manager can also view and edit all the catalogs from all of the stores. a chain manager can also view orders from all of the stores.

the chain manager can also view reports regarding all of the stores. a chain manager can view two reports simultaneously, and also compare the reports of two or more different stores. 

here's an example:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182030467-1a51ad66-9a26-4dff-bed0-fef4e431fd53.mp4

### Customer service employee

A Customer service employee can view the orders from all the stores. 
A Customer service employee can also view and answer complaints made by customers. the employee can also set a refund as a compansation to the complaining customer.

here is the comaplaint table:

![complaints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182030731-d49ea692-4298-4374-96fe-11ecc2495ff1.jpg)

and after clicking one of the complaints, we get this window, where the employee can respond to the customer and set a refund:

![comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73134488/182032356-83022993-1409-42d5-a868-6d67b166cae4.jpg)
