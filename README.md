Welcome! 

In here I will present LilachShop. LilachShop is a software for managing a flower store. 

firstly, I will present the customer side, where the customer can login to his accout, make new orders, cancel his orders, send complaints to the store he bought the flowers from, and view the store's reply to his complaints. 

so this is the first screen the user see before login to his account:

the user can press on different products from the list, and the pressed product will appear on the left side of the screen with additional information.

if the user tries to add products to his cart, theres an error that indicates the user needs to login, so we go to the login screen:

if the user already have an account, he can login. if not, he can create a new account.
let's say we want to create a new account. this video showes all the stages needed to make a new account:
- choose user name and a password (the user name needs to be a name that is not already being used).
- insert information: first name, last name, phone number, address and email
- insert credit card information  
- choose account type: chain, annual or store account.
